<br>
You can trigger the Free Spins Bonus by getting 3 Bonus symbols anywhere on the centre reels.
<br><br>
Upon triggering the Free Spins Bonus, you receive 5 free spins.
The reels used in the Free Spins Bonus are much richer, having more of the Stacked Wilds&trade; feature than the base game reels.

<br><br>
During the Free Spins Bonus,
you can retrigger the Bonus by getting three Bonus symbols anywhere on the centre three reels.
You can retrigger the Bonus multiple times, up to a maximum of 255 free spins per Bonus.


<br><br>
Your bet per line in the Bonus is equal to the bet per line on the reel spin that triggered the Bonus.

<br>
Malfunction voids all pays and plays.
<br><br>
All line pay symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive reels, beginning with the far left reel.
<br><br>
Only highest winner paid on each payline. Line wins are multiplied by the line bet on the winning line.
<br><br>
Only highest scatter pay award paid. Scatter pays are multiplied by the total bet.
<br><br>
Coinciding wins on different paylines are added. Scatter awards are
independent from payline awards and are also added to the total amount
paid.
<br><br>
Awards are shown in currency.
<br><br>
Regardless of your bet size, there is an award cap on any single
transaction.  See the paytable for details.  A transaction includes the
results of the Free Spins Bonus plus the outcome which launched the
bonus.  If the award cap is reached in the Bonus, the Bonus ends
immediately irrespective of any remaining free spins.
