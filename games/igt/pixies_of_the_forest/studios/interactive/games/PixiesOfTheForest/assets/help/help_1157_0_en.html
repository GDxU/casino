<br>
<span class="title">Free Spins Bonus</span>
<br>
You can trigger the Free Spins Bonus by getting three Bonus symbols on a wagered payline. Three Bonus symbols on multiple paylines does <i>not</i> trigger the Bonus multiple times. You can only trigger the Bonus once on a given spin.
<br><br>
Once you trigger the Free Spins Bonus, you are prompted to pick one of the Bonus symbols to reveal your awarded free spin count. You can earn 5 to 11 free spins.
<br><br>
The Free Spins Bonus is played automatically. Your coin value in the Bonus is equal to the coin value on the reel spin that triggered the Bonus. The Bonus reels are made richer by adding wilds to the first four reels.
<br><br>
A non-wild symbol must be part of any winning combination.
<br><br>
For example, the following outcome on a payline pays the award for five Ace symbols:
<br>
Wild &ndash; Wild &ndash; Wild &ndash; Wild &ndash; Ace
<br><br>
Bonus play continues until you have played through your free spins. You cannot retrigger additional free spins in the Free Spins Bonus.
