<br>
<span class="title"><em>Stacked Wilds</em> Feature</span>
<br>
With the <em>Stacked Wilds</em> feature, each reel is loaded with groups of four or more consecutive Wild symbols.

In the Free Spins Bonus, the <em>Stacked Wilds</em> feature is even richer and more plentiful.
<br><br>

<br>
<span class="title">Free Spins Bonus</span>
<br>
The Free Spins Bonus is triggered by getting three Bonus scatter symbols anywhere on the centre three reels. These symbols are only found on reels 2, 3, and 4.<br><br>

Triggering the Free Spins Bonus awards 5 free spins. The reels in the Free Spins Bonus have a richer, more plentiful <em>Stacked Wilds</em> feature than the base game reels.<br><br>

During the Free Spins Bonus, the bonus can be retriggered by getting three Bonus scatter symbols anywhere on the centre three reels. These symbols are only found on reels 2, 3, and 4. The Bonus can be retriggered multiple times, up to a maximum of 255 free spins per Bonus.<br><br>

Free spins are played at same line bet and same number of lines as the triggering game. <br><br>

Misuse or malfunction voids all pays and plays.<br><br>

All line win symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive reels, beginning with the far left reel.<br><br>

Only the highest winner is paid on each payline. Line wins are multiplied by the line bet on the winning line. Coinciding line wins on different paylines are added.<br><br>

Only the highest scatter win is paid. Scatter wins are multiplied by the total bet.<br><br>

Scatter wins are independent from line wins and are added to the total amount paid.<br><br>

Wins are shown in currency.<br><br>

Regardless of bet size, there is an award cap on any single transaction. See the paytable for details. A transaction includes the results of the Free Spins Bonus plus the outcome which launched the bonus. If the award cap is reached in the bonus, the bonus ends immediately irrespective of any remaining free spins. <br><br>

<a name="additionalInformation"></a>
<br>
<span class="title">Additional Information</span> 
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Expected Payback</span><br>
In accordance with fair gaming practices required in most legal jurisdictions worldwide, each and every game outcome is completely independent. The odds of getting any particular outcome are always the same.
<br><br>
The odds do not vary based on prior outcomes, bet size, balance size, time of day, day of week, etc. For example, if the top award is won on a given play of the game, the chances of winning the top award on the next play are exactly the same. Likewise, prior losses do not change future odds.
<br><br>
The expected payback reflects the theoretical return across a very large number of plays by numerous players over an extended period of time. The results for any given player over a play session can vary widely from this long-term, expected average in either direction. The fewer the number of games played, the wider the normal variance of actual payback that may be experienced.
