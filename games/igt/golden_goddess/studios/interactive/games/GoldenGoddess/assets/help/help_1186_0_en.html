<span class="title"><b><i>Super Stacks</i></b>&trade; Feature</span><br>
Each reel in <b><i>Golden Goddess</i></b>&trade; includes large stacks of the same symbol. Before each spin, a symbol is randomly selected to fill each reelâ€™s stacks. Any symbol may appear in any stack, except the Bonus scatter symbol which may appear on reels 2, 3, and 4 only. The same symbol may appear in large stacks on multiple reels on the same spin. When the same symbol appears in the stacks on adjacent reels, the potential for big wins increases.

<span class="title">Free Spins Bonus</span>
<br>
Nine Bonus scatter symbols on the centre three reels trigger the on-screen bonus picker.
These symbols are only found on reels 2, 3, and 4.
Choose a Bonus symbol to reveal a Goddess, Man, Horse, or Dove symbol.
The revealed symbol becomes the <b><i>Super Stacks</i></b>&trade; symbol found on all reels
for all spins in the Free Spins Bonus. 
Triggering the Free Spins Bonus awards seven free spins.
The bonus cannot be retriggered because no Bonus symbols appear on the reels during the Free Spins Bonus.
<br><br>
Free spins are played at the same line bet and same number of lines as the triggering spin.

<b>Expected Payback</b>
<br>
In accordance with fair gaming practices required in most legal jurisdictions worldwide,
each and every game outcome is completely independent.  The odds of getting any particular
outcome are always the same.
<br><br>
The odds do not vary based on prior outcomes, bet size, balance size, time of day, day of week, etc.
For example, if the top award is won on a given spin of the game, the chances of winning the top award
on the next spin are exactly the same. Likewise, prior losses do not change future odds.
<br><br>
The expected payback reflects the theoretical return across a very large number of spins by numerous
players over an extended period of time. The results for any given player over a play session can vary
widely from this long-term, expected average in either direction. The fewer the number of games played,
the wider the normal variance of actual payback that may be experienced.
