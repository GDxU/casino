<span class="title"><i>Dynamic Stacks</i> Feature</span><br>
Each reel includes large stacks of the same symbols. Before each spin, a symbol is randomly selected to fill every reels' stacks.<br><br> 
In the base game, any symbol, except the Bonus symbol, may appear in the stacks. All stacked symbol positions on all reels transform to the same symbol. On some spins, the stacks are even bigger, but only the four Hero symbols
(Drizzt, Wulfgar, Catti-brie, and Bruenor) may fill these bigger reel stacks.  Since the same symbol appears in the stacks on every reel, the potential for big wins increases.
<br><br>The Bonus symbol appears on reels 2, 3, and 4 only. In the Free Spins Bonus, only the four Hero symbols may fill the stacks.
<br><br>
[ <a href="#top">top</a> ]

<br><br>
<a name="bonus"></a>
<br>
<span class="title">Free Spins Bonus</span><br>
The Free Spins Bonus is triggered by getting three or more Bonus scatter symbols anywhere on the middle three reels. These symbols are found on reels 2, 3, and 4 only.
<br><br>
Start the Free Spins Bonus with 15 free spins and enjoy a richer <i>Dynamic Stacks</i> feature.  Get 3 Bonus scatter symbols anywhere on the middle three reels to retrigger the bonus for another 15 free spins.
These symbols are found on reels 2, 3, and 4 only.  The bonus can be retriggered multiple times, up to a maximum of 225 spins.<br><br>
The 20-sided Die symbol is wild in the bonus, and every time one appears on the fifth reel it is saved in a special on-screen accumulator.  
Collect 3 Dice total and all Drizzt symbols become wild on reels 2 through 5 for that spin and all subsequent spins in the bonus.
Furthermore, every additional three Dice upgrades an additional hero:
<ul>
<li>3 Dice: Drizzt is wild on reels 2 through 5
<li>6 Dice: Wulfgar is also wild on reels 2 through 5
<li>9 Dice: Catti-brie is also wild on reels 2 through 5
<li>12 Dice: Bruenor is also wild on reels 2 through 5
</ul>

Combining the <i>Dynamic Stacks</i> feature with the progressively wild heroes means the reels may contain 
large stacks of wild heroes!<br><br>

After 12 Dice have been collected, no more Dice can be collected, but the 20-sided Die symbol remains wild.
Once the bonus ends, all Dice accumulators are emptied.
<br><br>


Free spins are played at same line bet and same number of lines as the triggering game.<br>

<br>
Misuse or malfunction voids all pays and plays.  
<br><br>
All line win symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive reels, beginning with the far left reel. 
<br><br>
Only the highest winner is paid on each payline. Line wins are multiplied by the line bet on the winning line. Coinciding line wins on different paylines are added.  
<br><br>
Only the highest scatter win is paid per scatter symbol. Coinciding scatter wins from different scatter symbols are added. Scatter wins are multiplied by the total bet. 
<br><br>
Scatter wins are independent from line wins and are added to the total amount paid. 
<br><br>
Wins are shown in currency. 
<br><br>
Regardless of bet size, there is an award cap on any single transaction. 
See the paytable for details. 
A transaction includes the results of the Free Spins Bonus plus the outcome which launched the bonus. 
If the award cap is reached in the bonus, the bonus ends immediately irrespective of any remaining free spins.

<u>Expected Payback</u>
<br>
In accordance with fair gaming practices required in most legal jurisdictions worldwide, each and every game outcome is completely independent. The odds of getting any particular outcome are always the same.
<br><br>
The odds do not vary based on prior outcomes, bet size, balance size, time of day, day of week, etc. For example, if the top award is won on a given play of the game, the chances of winning the top award on the next play are exactly the same. Likewise, prior losses do not change future odds.
<br><br>
The expected payback reflects the theoretical return across a very large number of plays by numerous players over an extended period of time. The results for any given player over a play session can vary widely from this long-term, expected average in either direction. The fewer the number of games played, the wider the normal variance of actual payback that may be experienced.<br><br>
