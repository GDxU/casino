Three Bonus symbols in any position on the centre three reels trigger the Free Spins Bonus and award 2x the total bet. 
<br><br>
Triggering the Free Spins Bonus awards ten free spins. The reels in the Free Spins Bonus have a richer, more plentiful Stacked Wilds feature than the base game reels. 
<br><br>
During the Free Spins Bonus, the Bonus can be retriggered by getting three Bonus symbols anywhere on the centre three reels. Retriggering the Free Spins Bonus awards an additional ten free spins. The Bonus can be retriggered multiple times, up to a maximum of 255 free spins per Bonus.

All line pay symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive reels, beginning with the far left reel. 
<br><br>
Only highest winner paid on each payline. Line wins are multiplied by the line bet on the winning line.  
<br><br>
Coinciding wins on different paylines are added. 
<br><br>
Wins are shown in currency. 
<br><br>

Regardless of the bet size, there is an award cap on any single transaction. See the paytable for details. A transaction includes the results of the Free Spins Bonus plus the outcome which launched the Bonus.

<u>Expected Payback</u>
<br>
In accordance with fair gaming practices required in most legal jurisdictions worldwide, each and every game outcome is completely independent. The odds of getting any particular outcome are always the same.
<br><br>
The odds do not vary based on prior outcomes, bet size, balance size, time of day, day of week, etc. For example, if the top award is won on a given play of the game, the chances of winning the top award on the next play are exactly the same. Likewise, prior losses do not change future odds.
<br><br>
The expected payback reflects the theoretical return across a very large number of plays by numerous players over an extended period of time. The results for any given player over a play session can vary widely from this long-term, expected average in either direction. The fewer the number of games played, the wider the normal variance of actual payback that may be experienced.<br><br>
