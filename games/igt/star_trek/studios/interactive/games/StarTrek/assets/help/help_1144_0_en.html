<a name="intro"></a>
<span class="title">Introduction</span><br>

Immerse yourself in the <i><b>STAR TREK</b></i>&trade; universe while you travel through 30
paylines of thrilling action and four futuristic Free Spins bonuses, each based
on a <i><b>STAR TREK</b></i>&trade; officer:  <br><br>

In KIRK'S Bonus, step into the daring mind of Captain Kirk who doesn't believe
in no-win scenarios. Spin until you win and all wins tripled. <br><br>

In SPOCK'S Bonus, prepare to be emotionally compromised. Spock has literally
turned wild. Wild Spock symbols appear on most reels, greatly increasing the
value of your Free Spins. <br><br>

In UHURA'S Bonus, all communication channels are open. All Free Spins are
enhanced with super scatter awards for getting 3 or more Uhura or Wild symbols
anywhere on the reels. <br><br>

In SCOTTY'S Bonus, Scotty's giving it all she's got just for you. Start with 10
Free Spins and up to a 5X multiplier.  After the 5th Free Spin, Scotty doubles
your multiplier for your remaining Free Spins. <br><br>

Not only are there a huge number of bonus opportunities to explore, every bonus
is retriggerable multiple times. <br><br>

Play <i><b>STAR TREK</b></i>&trade; and your winnings may increase at warp speed! <br><br>

<a name="howtobet"></a> <span class="title">How To Bet</span><br><br>

<i><b>STAR TREK</b></i>&trade; features 30 paylines. You can choose how much to
bet per line. <br><br>

<b>LINE BET</b> <br>

Displays current bet per line shown in currency. Click the left arrow (with a
minus sign) to decrease bet per line. Click the right arrow (with a plus
sign) to increase bet per line. Clicking the left and right arrows does not
necessarily decrease or increase your line bet in a linear fashion. Rather,
your line bet decreases or increases at preset increments which represent the
most popular bet amounts. <br><br>

<b>LINES</b> <br>Displays current number of paylines selected. Betting is fixed at 30 lines.<br><br>

<b>SPIN</b> <br> Click to spin the reels and submit your bet. <br><br>

[ <a href="#top">top</a> ]<br><br><br>


<a name="autoSpin"></a>
<span class="title">Auto Spin Feature</span><br>

Auto Spin plays the game automatically for a given number of games at 30 lines and the current line bet. Once you have selected your desired line bet, click <b>AUTO SPIN</b> and choose how many games you want to play. Auto Spin will keep playing the specified number of games until you click the <b>STOP</b> button, you trigger a Bonus, or your balance is insufficient to spin again. Auto Spin is only available in approved jurisdictions.<br><br>

[ <a href="#top">top</a> ]<br><br><br>


<a name="bonus"></a>
<span class="title">Free Spins Bonuses</span><br>

You can trigger an Officer Bonus with two Bonus symbols anywhere on the second
and third reels, and then the appropriate Officer Bonus symbol (Kirk Bonus
Symbol, Spock Bonus Symbol, Uhura Bonus Symbol or Scotty Bonus Symbol) anywhere
on the fourth reel. <br><br>

This transitions you to the transporter room where you beam-up your Free Spin
opportunity. Click one of the three energized transporter pads to obtain your
value. <br>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">

</table><br><br>

From the transporter room, you move to your officer's Free Spin round.  Your
effective bet per line on each Free Spin is the same as the bet per line on the
reel spin that triggered the bonus. <br><br>

You can retrigger your bonus by getting three Bonus symbols anywhere on the
middle three reels.  When you retrigger the bonus, you receive the same number
of Free Spins (or in Kirk's bonus, Win Spins) that you received initially.  The
number of additional Free Spins or Win Spins is not affected by any bonus win
multiplier. You can earn up to a maximum of 250 Free Spins in any one bonus. <br><br>

[ <a href="#top">top</a> ]<br><br><br>


<a name="Kirk"></a>
<span class="title">Kirk Win Spins Bonus</span><br>

From the transporter room, beam up the number of Win Spins you've earned.  For
each Win Spin, spin until you win.  In this way, your number of Win Spins only
decrements if you get a winning Free Spin.  Your total number of Free Spins is
limited to 250.  Also, the retriggering of the bonus is counted as a win. <br><br>

When you get a win, all awards are tripled.  Also, there is a special Kirk/Spock
symbol that substitutes only for Kirk and Spock symbols.  This greatly increases
your chance of getting higher paying Kirk and Spock awards. <br><br>

[ <a href="#top">top</a> ]<br><br><br>


<a name="Spock"></a>
<span class="title">Spock Goes Wild Bonus</span><br>

From the transporter room, beam up the number of Free Spins you've earned.
There are Wild Spock symbols on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th reels.  Extra Wild
Spock symbols have been added to most reels.  Also, all Kirk pays are doubled,
emphasizing that Kirk is always more valuable when Spock is around. <br><br>

[ <a href="#top">top</a> ]<br><br><br>


<a name="Uhura"></a>
<span class="title">Uhura Super Scatter Bonus</span><br>

From the transporter room, beam up the number of Free Spins you've earned.
There are additional super scatter pays for getting 3 or more Uhura or Wild
symbols anywhere on the reels.  You can get up to 8 Uhura and Wild symbols on
the reels at once for a huge award.  These scatter awards are paid in addition
to any line awards for getting Uhura and Wild symbols. <br><br>

[ <a href="#top">top</a> ]<br><br><br>


<a name="Scotty"></a>
<span class="title">Scotty Multiplier Boost Bonus</span><br>

From the transporter room, beam up your award multiplier. After the first five
Free Spins, your multiplier doubles in size, greatly increasing the value of
your remaining Free Spins, including any Free Spins gained from retriggering the
bonus. <br><br>

[ <a href="#top">top</a> ]<br><br><br>

<a name="rules"></a>
<span class="title">Rules</span><br>

Malfunction voids all pays and plays. <br><br>

All line pay symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive reels,
beginning with the far left reel. <br><br>

All payline wins occur on bet lines only. <br><br>

Only highest winner paid on each payline. <br><br>

Only highest scatter pay awarded on any Uhura Free Spin. <br><br>

Only one award paid per payline. <br><br>

Line wins are multiplied by the line bet on the winning line.
<br><br>
Coinciding wins on
different paylines are added. Scatter awards are independent from payline
awards and are also added to the total amount paid. <br><br>

Awards are shown in currency. <br><br>

Regardless of your bet size, there is an award cap on any single transaction.
See the paytable for details. A transaction includes the results of any bonus
plus the outcome which launched the bonus. If the award cap is reached in a
bonus, that bonus may end early before all Free Spins or Win Spins have been
completed. <br><br>
