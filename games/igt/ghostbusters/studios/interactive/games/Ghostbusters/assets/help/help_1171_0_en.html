<br>
<span class="title">Ballroom Busters Bonus</span>
<br>
The Ballroom Busters Bonus is triggered by getting two Bonus symbols anywhere on the second and third reels, and a Slimer Bonus symbol anywhere on the fourth reel.
<br><br>
Use five proton shots to try to uncover any of the six ghosts hiding behind highlighted objects in the ballroom.  Press a highlighted object to fire a proton shot at it.
  If a ghost is hiding in the selected spot, you win an award. This award may be multiplied by a special prize multiplier of 2X to 5X. If no ghost is hiding in the selected spot, press a different highlighted object to try again.

<br><br>
After all 5 proton shots have been fired, the bonus ends and the total bonus win is awarded.

<br><br>
The Bonus award values are based on the coin value on the reel spin that triggered the Bonus.

<br><br>

<br><br>
<a name="bonus2"></a>
<br>
<span class="title">Stay Puft Bonus</span>
<br>
The Stay Puft Bonus is triggered by getting two Bonus symbols anywhere on the second and third reels, and a Stay Puft Bonus symbol anywhere on the fourth reel.
<br><br>
Win 8 free spins.  Free spins played on 40 lines -- 10 more lines than the base game!<br><br>
After any free spin, marshmallows may land on one or more reel positions turning them into locked wilds. Each of these wilds remain on the reels for the remaining free spins.
Line wins are paid on the final reel state only.
After any free spin, the win meter may open and take in a marshmallow, paying a random award in addition to any line wins.

<br><br>
Different reels are used during the free spins.  The coin value in the Bonus is equal to the coin value on the reel spin that triggered the Bonus.
The Bonus ends when no more free spins remain and the Bonus cannot be retriggered.
Locked wilds are cleared at the conclusion of the Bonus.

<span class="title">Rules and Additional Information</span>
<br>
Misuse or malfunction voids all pays and plays.
<br><br>
All line pay symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive reels, beginning with the far left reel.
<br><br>
Only highest winner paid on each payline. Line wins are multiplied by the coin value on the winning line.
<br><br>
Only highest scatter pay award paid. Scatter pays are multiplied by the total bet.
<br><br>
Coinciding wins on different paylines are added. Scatter awards are independent from payline awards and are also added to the total amount paid.
<br><br>
Awards are shown in currency.
<br><br>
Regardless of the bet size, there is an award cap on any single transaction.  See the paytable for details.  A transaction includes the results of a Bonus plus the outcome which launched the bonus.  If the award cap is reached in a Bonus, the Bonus ends immediately irrespective of any remaining free spins.
