In Cats&#8482;&#44; each cat symbol comes in two varieties&#58; single symbols and double symbols&#46; Single symbols have one cat on them&#46; Double symbols&#44; which use the Split Symbols&#8482; feature&#44; have two of the same cat on them&#46;  There are single and double versions of each cat on every reel&#46;  Winning outcomes are based on the number of matching cats on a payline &#40;from left to right&#41;&#44; not just the number of matching symbols&#46;  Enjoy wins by getting as few as &#51; matching cats and as many as &#49;&#48; matching cats for huge wins&#46;  Similarly&#44; you can win a &#51;&#45;symbol pay or even a &#52;&#45;symbol pay on just the first two reels&#46;<br>
          <br>
This lucrative Split Symbols&#8482; feature is enhanced by the <b>Cats</b>&#8482; <b>Logo</b> symbol&#46;  The <b>Cats</b>&#8482; <b>Logo</b> symbol is wild and can substitute for the highest&#45;paying cat symbol or highest&#45;paying royal symbol that completes a win&#46;  When substituting for an cat symbol&#44; <b>Cats</b>&#8482; <b>Logo</b> symbols are always evaluated using the Split Symbols&#8482; feature &#45; making these wild symbols extremely valuable&#46;<br>
