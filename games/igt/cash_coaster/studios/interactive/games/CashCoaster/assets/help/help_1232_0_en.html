<u>Expected Payback</u>
<br>
In accordance with fair gaming practices required in most legal jurisdictions worldwide, each and every 
game outcome is completely independent. The odds of getting any particular outcome are always the same.
<br><br>
The odds do not vary based on prior outcomes, bet size, balance size, time of day, day of week, etc. 
For example, if the top award is won on a given spin of the game, the chances of winning the top award 
on the next spin are exactly the same. Likewise, prior losses do not change future odds.
<br><br>
The expected payback reflects the theoretical return across a very large number of spins by numerous 
players over an extended period of time. The results for any given player over a play session can vary 
widely from this long-term, expected average in either direction. The fewer the number of games played, 
the wider the normal variance of actual payback that may be experienced.
