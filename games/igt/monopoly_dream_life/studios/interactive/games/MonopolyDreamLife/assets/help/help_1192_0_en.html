<br>
<span class="title"><i>Dream Life</i> Bonus</span><br>
Trigger the <i>Dream Life</i> Bonus by getting three Bonus symbols on a payline.<br>  
<br>
To play:<br>
<br>
Earn a number of free spins by collecting four property cards.<br>
Some cards award more free spins than others, and pairs of the same colour award more than two singles of that colour.<br>
The onscreen paytable shows how many free spins each single card and each pair of cards is worth.<br> 
Select one of the face-down cards from the table to reveal its colour.<br>
Decide whether to keep the card or discard it. Choose carefully as a maximum of two can be discarded.<br>
There are exactly two cards of each colour available among the face-down cards.<br>
Continue selecting face-down cards until four have been kept.<br>
The number of free spins awarded is the total of the free spins awarded for each pair and each single property card kept.<br>
Free spins cannot be retriggered.
<br>
The reels used in the resulting free spins bonus have bigger stacks of wild symbols than in the base game, giving richer payouts.<br> 
<br>
The bet in the bonus is equal to the bet on the reel spin that triggered the bonus.<br>

<span class="title">Rules and Additional Information</span>
<br>
Misuse or malfunction voids all pays and plays.
<br><br>
Only highest winner paid on each payline. Line wins are multiplied by the line bet on the winning line.
<br><br>
All line win symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive reels, beginning with the far left reel.
<br><br>
Wild symbol appears on reels 2, 3, and 4 only.
<br><br>
Bonus symbol appears on reels 1, 2, and 3 in the base game.
<br><br>
Reels used in free spins bonus are different from the reels used in the base game. There are no bonus symbols in the free spins bonus.
<br><br>
Coinciding wins on different paylines are added. Scatter wins are independent from payline wins and are also added to the total amount paid. 
<br><br>
Wins are shown in currency.
<br><br>
Regardless of the bet size, there is an award cap on any single transaction. See the paytable for details.
A transaction includes the results of the free spins bonus plus the outcome which launched the bonus. 
If the award cap is reached in the bonus, the bonus ends immediately irrespective of any remaining free spins.<br><br>
