<br><br>
Bonus symbol appears on reels 2, 3, and 4 only.
<br><br>
Coinciding wins on different paylines are added. Scatter wins are independent from payline wins and are also added to the total amount paid. 
<br><br>
Wins are shown in currency.
<br><br>
Reels used in Free Spins Bonus are different from the reels used in the base game.
<br><br>
Regardless of the bet size, there is an award cap on any single transaction. See the paytable for details.
A transaction includes the results of the Free Spins Bonus plus the outcome which launched the bonus. 
If the award cap is reached in the bonus, the bonus ends immediately irrespective of any remaining free spins.<br><br>

<b>Expected Payback</b>
<br>
In accordance with fair gaming practices required in most legal jurisdictions worldwide, each and every game outcome is completely independent. The odds of getting any particular outcome are always the same. 
<br><br>
The odds do not vary based on prior outcomes, bet size, balance size, time of day, day of week, etc. For example, if the top award is won on a given spin of the game, the chances of winning the top award on the next spin are exactly the same. Likewise, prior losses do not change future odds. 
<br><br>
The expected payback reflects the theoretical return across a very large number of spins by numerous players over an extended period of time. The results for any given player over a play session can vary widely from this long-term, expected average in either direction. The fewer the number of games played, the wider the normal variance of actual payback that may be experienced.
