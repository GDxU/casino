<span class="title">Mystery Wild Bonus</span>
<br>
The Mystery Wild Bonus can be triggered after any base game reel outcome that does not contain a Logo symbol on the first reel or a Board Bonus symbol on any reel.
<br><br>
When the Mystery Wild Bonus is triggered, MR. MONOPOLY suddenly appears, hopping from reel to reel until he selects a reel to turn wild.  MR. MONOPOLY may continue turning reels wild, possibly turning all five reels wild for an enormous payout.

<br><br>
<a name="bonus"></a>
<br>
<span class="title">Board Bonus</span>
<br>
You can trigger the Board Bonus by getting three Board Bonus symbols anywhere on the first, third and fifth reels. You are then prompted to pick one of the three Board Bonus symbols to reveal your initial number of rolls: two, three, or four.
<br><br>
On your way to the Board Bonus, you are asked to pick your lucky mover.  Your choice of mover does not affect your game payback.
<br><br>
Pays awarded in the Board Bonus are multiplied by your bet per line on the reel spin that triggered the bonus.
<br><br>
In the Board Bonus, MR. MONOPOLY prompts you to click the ROLL button to roll the dice.
Your mover starts on the GO square.  Your mover moves the number of board spots equal to your dice roll total.
Rolling doubles earns you an extra roll.  Rolling doubles three times in a row triggers the Jail Bonus.
<br><br>
Different bonus features are awarded all along the board.
<br><br>
<b>Property Bonus:</b>  If you land on a property, you get one spin on a mini-slot machine.  You can win both money and/or extra dice rolls depending on the symbols that land on the centre payline. As you progress around the board, the mini-slot machines offer richer and richer awards with Wild, 2xWild, and 3xWild symbols.  See the paytable for details.
<br><br>
<b>Utility Bonus:</b>  If you land on a utility, you get one roll of the Utility dice.  The higher the sum of the Utility dice, the bigger the award you win.  See the paytable for details.  Rolling doubles also earns you an extra roll in the Board Bonus.  Your mover does not move based on the dice roll in the Utility Bonus.
<br><br>
<b>CHANCE/COMMUNITY CHEST Bonus:</b>  If you land on CHANCE or COMMUNITY CHEST, you receive a random card from the corresponding deck which may:<ul>
<li> Move your mover to a property spot
</li><li> Move your mover to a utility spot
</li><li> Move your mover to the GO square
</li><li> Award you a cash prize
</li><li> Award you extra rolls
</li><li> Send you directly to the Jail Bonus
</li></ul>
<b>Railroad Bonus:</b>  If you land on a railroad, your mover advances to the next railroad spot on the board and you earn an extra roll.
<br><br>
<b>Free Parking Bonus:</b>  If you land on the Free Parking square, you earn an extra roll.
<br><br>
<b>Go to Jail:</b>  If you land on the Go to Jail square, your mover is sent directly to Jail and the Jail Bonus begins.  You do not pass GO or collect the GO award when this happens.
<br><br>
<b>Jail Bonus:</b>  In the Jail Bonus, your mover is moved directly to the Jail square on the board.
You do not collect the GO award when you go to the Jail Bonus.
In the Jail Bonus, you have three attempts to roll doubles.
If you roll doubles once in the three tries, you get out of Jail and receive a special award. (See the paytable for details.)
Otherwise, you resume your Board Bonus from the Jail square.
You do not get an extra roll if you roll doubles in the Jail Bonus.
Also, your mover is not moved by any of your dice rolls in the Jail Bonus.
<br><br>
<b>GO Bonus:</b>  If you land on or pass the GO square, you are awarded 200x your triggering line bet.  You do not collect this award when being sent to the Jail Bonus.
<br><br>
<b>Income Tax, Just Visiting, Super Tax:</b>  If you land on Income Tax, Just Visiting, or Super Tax, you receive no awards.

<ul><li>Triggering the Board Bonus
</li><li>Landing on a property
</li><li>Landing on a utility
</li><li>Landing on or passing GO
</li><li>Landing on Income Tax, Just Visiting, or Super Tax

You gain more MONOPOLY money for landing on properties on the richest sides of the board.
The MONOPOLY money you earn persists across play sessions and carries over from game to game.
<br><br>
The MONOPOLY money meter, visible in the top left corner of the Board Bonus or on the first page of the paytable, shows your MONOPOLY money balance
and the percentage of completion until you reach the next level.
<br><br>
When your MONOPOLY money balance reaches certain thresholds, you level up.  See the paytable for the thresholds.  When you level up, you gain a new title and immediately
unlock either new player movers or new Board Bonus features.  Additionally, the amount of MONOPOLY money you earn by landing on properties is boosted as you level up.
