<br>
Three Bonus symbols in any position on the centre three reels trigger the Free Spins Bonus. 
<br><br>
Triggering the Free Spins Bonus awards three initial free spins.
The reels in the Free Spins Bonus have fewer symbols for more frequent wins.

<br><br>
During the Free Spins Bonus, the bonus can be retriggered by getting one or more Diamond Run symbols anywhere on the reels. 
Retriggering the Free Spins Bonus awards one additional free spin. Be prepared for a lot
of extra spins as this game retriggers often.
The bonus can be retriggered up to a maximum of 100 free spins per bonus. 

<br><br>
The bet in the bonus is the same as on the reel spin that triggered the bonus.

All line win symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive reels, beginning with the far left reel.
<br><br>

<br><br>
If one or more Rich Girl logo symbols substitute in a base game win, the pay for that win is doubled.
<br><br>
If one or more Diamond Run symbols substitute in a free spin win, the pay for that win is doubled.

Scatter wins are multiplied by the total bet.

Wins are shown in currency.
<br><br>
