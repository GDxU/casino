Misuse or malfunction voids all pays and plays.
<br><br>
Only highest winner paid on each payline. Line wins are multiplied by the line bet on the winning line.
<br><br>
All line win symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive reels, beginning with the far left reel.
<br><br>
Wild symbol appears on reels 2, 3, and 4 only.
<br><br>
Bonus symbol appears on reels 1, 3, and 5 only in the base game.
<br><br>
Reels used in the Free Spins Bonuses are different from the reels used in the base game. There are no bonus symbols in the Free Spins Bonus.
<br><br>
Coinciding wins on different paylines are added. 
<br><br>
Wins are shown in currency.
<br><br>
Regardless of the bet size, there is an award cap on any single transaction. See the paytable for details.
A transaction includes the results of the Free Spins Bonus plus the outcome which launched the bonus. 
If the award cap is reached in the bonus, the bonus ends immediately irrespective of any remaining free spins.<br><br>

<b>Expected Payback</b>
<br>
In accordance with fair gaming practices required in most legal jurisdictions worldwide, each and every 
game outcome is completely independent. The odds of getting any particular outcome are always the same.
<br><br>
The odds do not vary based on prior outcomes, bet size, balance size, time of day, day of week, etc. 
For example, if the top award is won on a given spin of the game, the chances of winning the top award 
on the next spin are exactly the same. Likewise, prior losses do not change future odds.
<br><br>
The expected payback reflects the theoretical return across a very large number of spins by numerous 
players over an extended period of time. The results for any given player over a play session can vary 
widely from this long-term, expected average in either direction. The fewer the number of games played, 
the wider the normal variance of actual payback that may be experienced.
