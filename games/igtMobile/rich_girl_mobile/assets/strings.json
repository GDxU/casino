Choose to play any number of lines.</p> <h3>BET CONFIGURATION MENU</h3> <p>Press {menu} to open the bet configuration menu.</p> <h3>LINE BET</h3> <p>Displays the current bet per line shown in currency.</p> <p>Press {left} to decrease the bet per line.</p> <p>Press {right} to increase the bet per line.</p> <h3>LINES</h3> <p>Displays the current number of paylines selected.</p> <p>Press {left} to decrease the number of paylines played.</p> <p>Press {right} to increase the number of paylines played.</p> <h3>CONFIRM</h3> <p>Press {tick} to confirm and close the bet configuration menu.</p> <h3>SPIN</h3> <p>Press {spin} to spin the reels and submit the bet.</p> <h2>Free Spins Bonus</h2> <p>Three Bonus symbols in any position on the centre three reels trigger the Free Spins Bonus.</p> <p>Triggering the Free Spins Bonus awards three initial free spins. The reels in the Free Spins Bonus have fewer symbols for more frequent wins.</p> <p>During the Free Spins Bonus, the bonus can be retriggered by getting one or more Diamond Run symbols anywhere on the reels. Retriggering the Free Spins Bonus awards one additional free spin. Be prepared for a lot of extra spins as this game retriggers often. The bonus can be retriggered up to a maximum of 100 free spins per bonus.</p> <p>The bet in the bonus is the same as the reel spin that triggered the bonus.</p> <h2>Diamond Run Feature</h2> <p>In the Free Spins Bonus, the Current Run and Record Run meters keep track of the number of free spins. The Current Run meter displays the number of times the reels have spun so far in the current bonus. The Record Run meter displays the longest run achieved by the player across all play sessions. The maximum achievable run is 100 free spins.</p> <h2>Rules</h2> <p>Misuse or malfunction voids all pays and plays.</p> <p>All line win symbols must appear on a played line and on consecutive reels, beginning with the far left reel.</p> <p>Only highest winner paid on each payline. Line wins are multiplied by the line bet on the winning line.</p> <p>If one or more Rich Girl logo symbols substitute in a base game win, the pay for that win is doubled.</p> <p>If one or more Diamond Run symbols substitute in a free spin win, the pay for that win is doubled.</p> <p>Scatter wins are multiplied by the total bet.</p> <p>Coinciding wins on different paylines are added. Scatter wins are independent from payline wins and are also added to the total amount paid.</p> <p>Wins are shown in currency.</p> <p>Bonus symbols appear in columns 2, 3, and 4 only in the base game.</p> <p>Regardless of the bet size, there is an award cap on any single transaction. See the paytable for details. A transaction includes the results of the Free Spins Bonus plus the outcome which launched the bonus. If the award cap is reached in the bonus, the bonus ends immediately irrespective of any remaining free spins.</p> <p>All trademarks are registered trademarks or pending trademarks of IGT in the U.S. and\/or other countries. © 2014 IGT.
